Let me explain the rule of the present indicative to help you understand and progress.<br>The present indicative tense is used to describe actions that are currently taking place, general facts or permanent situations. In this tense, verbs are conjugated according to the subject and time of the action.<br>In the given sentence, we use the verb \"catch\" with the subject \"Lily\". Instead of using the incorrect form \"catched\", we need to use the correct form \"catch\" to match the present tense.<br>Here's an example to illustrate the correction: \"Lily might catch a little cold.\""
